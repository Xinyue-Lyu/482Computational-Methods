Course 482: Computational Methods For Data Analysis

The five assignments are exploring the topics:
  1. Using FFT(Fourier Transform), denoising filters, and averaging technique to track machine producing signals with noices.
  2. Dimensioinality reduction by two Principal Component Analysis(PCA).
  3. To classify handwritten digits from MNIST dataset, applying Ridge regression, k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
  4. Classifying images from FashinMNIST dataset by Fuly-connected nerual network (FCN) with hyperparameter tuning and optimizers.
  5. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) was used to compare with FCN and explore accuracies by adjusting model sizes.
